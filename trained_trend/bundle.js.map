Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n\t// cause the system to run out of memory.\n\t//\n\t// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n\t// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n\t// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\t\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Transform;\n\t\n\tvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(4);\n\t\n\t/*<replacement>*/\n\tvar util = __webpack_require__(9);\n\tutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(10);\n\t/*</replacement>*/\n\t\n\tutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\t\n\tfunction TransformState(stream) {\n\t  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n\t    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  this.needTransform = false;\n\t  this.transforming = false;\n\t  this.writecb = null;\n\t  this.writechunk = null;\n\t  this.writeencoding = null;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n\t  var ts = stream._transformState;\n\t  ts.transforming = false;\n\t\n\t  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\t\n\t  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\t\n\t  ts.writechunk = null;\n\t  ts.writecb = null;\n\t\n\t  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\t\n\t  cb(er);\n\t\n\t  var rs = stream._readableState;\n\t  rs.reading = false;\n\t  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n\t    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction Transform(options) {\n\t  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\t\n\t  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\t\n\t  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\t\n\t  var stream = this;\n\t\n\t  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\t  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\t\n\t  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n\t  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n\t  // sync guard flag.\n\t  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\t\n\t  if (options) {\n\t    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\t  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n\t    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n\t      done(stream, er, data);\n\t    });else done(stream);\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n\t  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n\t  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n\t};\n\t\n\t// This is the part where you do stuff!\n\t// override this function in implementation classes.\n\t// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n\t//\n\t// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n\t// to the readable side.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

In these tasks, you will be presented with an interactive visualization dashboard of some stock price data. You will be asked to read values from this visualization, which requires interacting with it to reveal more information.</p>\r\n        <p>The results of these tasks will be used for a research study on visual perception for interactive visualizations. The purpose of the study is to inform the design of interfaces for visual analytics tasks when there are delays. You may view our <a href=\"./policy.html\" target=\"_blank\">privacy policy</a> for more information. Your anonymized data may be used for publication.</p>\r\n        <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary, and you will receive a ${taskReward.toFixed(2)} reward for each task completed. After completing all of the tasks, you will receive a ${bonusReward.toFixed(2)} completion bonus reward. You <b>must</b> complete all the tasks in this HIT to receive the completion bonus. If you do not wish to complete all the tasks, you can press the \"Finish and claim current reward\" button to exit this HIT and be paid your accumulated reward. You will only be paid once you complete all the tasks or click the finish button, given that the tasks are done with reasonable effort (i.e. no completely arbitrary guessing).</p>\r\n        <p>If you are ready to begin, please click the button below.</p>\r\n        <div className=\"button-wrapper\">\r\n          <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled}>I understand, and consent to participate</button>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/tslint-loader!./src/components/ExperimentInstructions.tsx","import * as React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nimport MergedContainer from \"./MergedContainer\";\r\nimport TrendGlyphContainer from \"./TrendGlyphContainer\";\r\nimport { getAnswers, getMiddleStockData, facetValues, getTrendAnswers } from \"../lib/data\";\r\nimport { TaskType, Encoding, Widget, TaskMode, TaskQuestions, TaskInstructions } from \"../lib/experiment\";\r\n\r\ninterface ExperimentTaskProps {\r\n  betweenSubjectsParams: any;\r\n  cancel?: () => void;\r\n  isTraining: boolean;\r\n  next: () => void;\r\n  submitAnswer: (data: any) => void;\r\n  taskReward?: number;\r\n  withinSubjectsParams: any[];\r\n  taskType: TaskType;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface ExperimentTaskState {\r\n  step: number;\r\n  view: number;\r\n  error: boolean;\r\n  answer: string;\r\n  widget: Widget;\r\n  moneyEarned: number;\r\n  taskStartTime: number;\r\n  answerStartTime: number;\r\n  answerEndTime: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class ExperimentTask extends React.Component<ExperimentTaskProps, ExperimentTaskState> {\r\n  viz: MergedContainer;\r\n\r\n  constructor(props: ExperimentTaskProps) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.showAnswerBox = this.showAnswerBox.bind(this);\r\n    this.submitAnswer = this.submitAnswer.bind(this);\r\n    this.changeAnswer = this.changeAnswer.bind(this);\r\n    this.changeAnswerTrend = this.changeAnswerTrend.bind(this);\r\n    this.continue = this.continue.bind(this);\r\n    this.cancel = this.cancel.bind(this);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      step: 0,\r\n      view: 0,\r\n      error: false,\r\n      answer: null,\r\n      widget: Widget.Facet,\r\n      moneyEarned: 0,\r\n      taskStartTime: Date.now(),\r\n      answerStartTime: null,\r\n      answerEndTime: null,\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  showAnswerBox() {\r\n    this.setState(prevState => {\r\n      return {\r\n        view: prevState.view + 1,\r\n        answerStartTime: Date.now(),\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  changeAnswer(event: any) {\r\n    this.setState({ answer: event.target.value });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  changeAnswerTrend(event: any) {\r\n    this.setState({ answer: event.target.dataset.value});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  submitAnswer() {\r\n    this.setState(prevState => {\r\n      const { step, view, answer, taskStartTime, answerStartTime } = prevState;\r\n      const { isTraining, submitAnswer, taskType, withinSubjectsParams } = this.props;\r\n      if (answer == null) {\r\n        return { error: true };\r\n      } else if (taskType === TaskType.EXTREMA) {\r\n        const answerChoices = [\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\"];\r\n        if (answerChoices.indexOf(answer) === -1) {\r\n          return { error: true };\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      const answerEndTime = Date.now();\r\n      const taskMode = isTraining ?
